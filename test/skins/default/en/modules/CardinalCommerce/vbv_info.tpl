<b>Verified by Visa gives you added online security.</b> Help protect your existing Visa card with a password you create, giving you reassurance that only you can use your Visa card online.
<br><br>
Simply activate your card and create your personal password. You'll get the added confidence that your Visa card is safe when you shop online.
<br><br>
<b>It's quick and easy.</b><br>
You may activate now by entering your card number over Visa's secure server. If your card issuer is participating in Verified by Visa (most issuers are) you'll complete a brief activation process. You'll verify your identity, create your Verified by Visa password and you're done.
<br><br>
<b>To get started, click the "Activate Now" button at the bottom of this page.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Your card is automatically recognized.</b><br>
Once your card is activated, your card number will be recognized whenever you purchase at this site or at other participating online stores. You'll enter your password in the Verified by Visa window, your identity will be verified, and the transaction will be completed. In stores that are not yet participating in Verified by Visa, your Visa card will continue to work as usual.
