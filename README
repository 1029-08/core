LiteCommerce is a free PHP/MySQL-driven open-source e-commerce solution that allows you to build a multifunctional e-commerce website (with forums, blog, articles, and so on) instead of just an online catalog with a checkout. At this moment, LiteCommerce can be easily integrated with Drupal in order to use all powerful features of Drupal CMS.

We are looking for contributors who could help us extend LiteCommerce and make it better. Translations to other languages are welcome as well.
