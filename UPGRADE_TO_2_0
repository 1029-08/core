# Upgrade from 2.0-ALPHA4 to 2.0-BETA1

## Console migrated to Symfony Console

The Doctrine CLI has been replaced by Symfony Console Configuration

## Collection API

The Collection interface in the Common package has been updated with some missing methods
that were present only on the default implementation, ArrayCollection. Custom collection
implementations need to be updated to adhere to the updated interface.
