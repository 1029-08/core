<p align="justify"><b>Note:</b> During the importing process, the Import Log report is created. This report (titled pluslog.txt) lists information about any problems that occurred during the importing process, as well as information about rejected duplicate records. This report is created as a text file, and can be opened in a text editor like Notepad. It is located in the same place as your company file. The errors and warnings that occurred during the import process are listed at the bottom of the report and correspond to the number in front of each record.

<p align="justify">Each time you import, a new Import Log report (titled pluslog.txt) is created, using the same name. If an Import Log report already exists when you create another one, the existing report will be removed.

<p>Please refer to your MYOB Manual for further assistance.
