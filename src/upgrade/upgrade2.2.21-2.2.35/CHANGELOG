Version 2.1 Service Pack 2:
   - Fixed a bug with 'Orders per page' and 'Users per page' option.
   - Fixed a bug with importing date containing quotes in product catalog.
   - Product & extra fields importing logic is changed. The decision of creating or updating the data is made under the following rules:
        1. If product SKU is specified in input, it is used to locate a product; if the product is not found, it is created then;
        2. If no SKU is given, the category/name combination is used.
        3. If there is no category in input, only product name is used to find a product.

Version 2.1.1 (Service Pack 1):

   - Fixed a navigation problem - a cart did not return to the proper product list page after adding a product to the cart.
   - Fixed a bug in the Search statistics dialog: statistics were not ordered properly, no product count was calculated.
   - The 'General settings/Security' dialog does not now allow to turn HTTPS on if there are HTTPS problems.
   - Fixed a bug regarding cloning a product: the product's extra fields were not cloned.
   - The product search input field is improved. The upgrade patch won't change your current search_product.tpl template, use the corresponding template from skins_original instead.

   - ASP: 'Secure shop URL' parameter is added (--secure-url in command line)
