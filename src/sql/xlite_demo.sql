INSERT INTO xlite_category_translations VALUES (1,'en',14015,'Fruit','<p>In botany, a fruit is the ripened ovary, together with its seeds, of a flowering plant. In cuisine, when discussing fruit as food, the term usually refers to just those plant fruits that are sweet and fleshy, examples of which would be plum, apple, and orange. However, a great many common vegetables, as well as nuts and grains, are the fruit of the plants they come from. Fruits that might not be considered such in a culinary context include gourds (e.g. squash and pumpkin), maize, tomatoes, and green peppers. These are fruits to a botanist, but are generally treated as vegetables in cooking. Some spices, such as allspice and nutmeg, are fruits. Rarely, culinary \"fruits\" are not fruits in the botanical sense, such as rhubarb in which only the sweet leaf petiole is edible.</p>\n<p>The term false fruit is sometimes applied to a fruit, like the fig (a multiple-accessory fruit) or to a plant structure that resembles a fruit but is not derived from a flower or flowers. Some gymnosperms, such as yew, have fleshy arils that resemble fruits and some junipers have berry-like, fleshy cones.</p>\n<div style=\"padding: 24px 24px 24px 21px; display: block; background-color: #ececec;\">From <a style=\"color: #1e7ec8; text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.knowledgerush.com\">www.knowledgerush.com</a></div>','','','');

It is one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits. The tree is small and deciduous, reaching 3 to 12 metres (9.8 to 39 ft) tall, with a broad, often densely twiggy crown. The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals 5 to 12 cm long and 3&ndash;6 centimetres (1.2&ndash;2.4 in) broad on a 2 to 5 centimetres (0.79 to 2.0 in) petiole with an acute tip, serrated margin and a slightly downy underside. Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves. The flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, and 2.5 to 3.5 centimetres (0.98 to 1.4 in) in diameter. The fruit matures in autumn, and is typically 5 to 9 centimetres (2.0 to 3.5 in) diameter. The center of the fruit contains five carpels arranged in a five-point star, each carpel containing one to three seeds.</p>\n<p>The tree originated from Central Asia, where its wild ancestor is still found today. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.</p>\n<p>vAt least 55 million tonnes of apples were grown worldwide in 2005, with a value of about $10 billion. China produced about 35% of this total. The United States is the second leading producer, with more than 7.5% of the world production. Turkey, France, Italy, and Iran are also among the leading apple exporters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"padding: 24px 24px 24px 21px; display: block; background-color: #ececec;\">From <a style=\"color: #1e7ec8; text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a>, the free encyclopedia</div>', `price` = '1.99', `sale_price` = '1.99', `sku` = '00000', `weight` = '0.32', `image` = 'demo_p15090.jpeg', `image_height` = '476', `image_width` = '500', `image_type` = 'image/jpeg', `image_size` = '125664', `image_source` = 'F', `thumbnail` = 'demo_t15090.jpeg', `thumbnail_height` = '152', `thumbnail_width` = '160', `thumbnail_type` = 'image/jpeg', `thumbnail_size` = '12605', `thumbnail_source` = 'F';

Each pod contains several peas. Although it is botanically a fruit, it is treated as a vegetable in cooking. The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and the seeds from several species of Lathyrus.</p>\n<p>P. sativum is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year. It is a cool season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter through to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 grams. The species is used as a vegetable - fresh, frozen or canned, and is also grown to produce dry peas like the split pea. These varieties are typically called field peas.</p>\n<p>The wild pea is restricted to the Mediterranean basin and the Near East. The earliest archaeological finds of peas come from Neolithic Syria, Turkey and Jordan. In Egypt, early finds come from c. 4800&ndash;4400 BC in the delta area, and from c. 3800&ndash;3600 BC in Upper Egypt. The pea was also present in 5th millennium BC Georgia. Further east, the finds are younger. Pea remains were retrieved from Afghanistan c. 2000 BC. They were present in 2250&ndash;1750 BC Harappa Pakistan and north-west India, from the older phases of this culture onward. In the second half of the 2nd millennium BC this pulse crop appears in the Gangetic basin and southern India.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"padding: 24px 24px 24px 21px; display: block; background-color: #ececec;\">From <a style=\"color: #1e7ec8; text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a>, the free encyclopedia</div>', `price` = '3.45', `sale_price` = '3.45', `sku` = '00006', `weight` = '0.55', `image` = 'demo_p16280.jpeg', `image_height` = '320', `image_width` = '480', `image_type` = 'image/jpeg', `image_size` = '89674', `image_source` = 'F', `thumbnail` = 'demo_t16280.jpeg', `thumbnail_height` = '107', `thumbnail_width` = '160', `thumbnail_type` = 'image/jpeg', `thumbnail_size` = '8073', `thumbnail_source` = 'F';

The flesh is very delicate and easily bruised in some cultivars, but is fairly firm in some commercial varieties, especially when green. The single, large seed is red-brown, oval shaped, approximately 1.3&ndash;2 cm long, and is surrounded by a wood-like husk. Peaches, along with cherries, plums and apricots, are stone fruits (drupes).

The modern botanical consensus is that they originate in China, and were introduced to Persia and the Mediterranean region along the Silk Road before Christian times.[1] Cultivated peaches are divided into clingstones and freestones, depending on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not; both can have either white or yellow flesh. Peaches with white flesh typically are very sweet with little acidity, while yellow-fleshed peaches typically have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness, though this also varies greatly. Both colours often have some red on their skin. Low-acid white-fleshed peaches are the most popular kinds in China, Japan, and neighbouring Asian countries, while Europeans and North Americans have historically favoured the acidic, yellow-fleshed kinds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"padding: 24px 24px 24px 21px; display: block; background-color: #ececec;\">From <a style=\"color: #1e7ec8; text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a>, the free encyclopedia</div>', `price` = '8.99', `sale_price` = '8.99', `sku` = '00002', `weight` = '0.32', `image` = 'demo_p15091.jpeg', `image_height` = '480', `image_width` = '480', `image_type` = 'image/jpeg', `image_size` = '163746', `image_source` = 'F', `thumbnail` = 'demo_t15091.jpeg', `thumbnail_height` = '160', `thumbnail_width` = '160', `thumbnail_type` = 'image/jpeg', `thumbnail_size` = '9412', `thumbnail_source` = 'F';
