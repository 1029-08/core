System architecture // {{{                                     *architecture*
===================

X-CART LITE project based on MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The
application core contained in the model (kernel components), data presentation
handled by the view (visual widged components) and controls handled by the 
dialog components wich are interact with the data in the model.

Handling request // {{{                                    *handling_request*
================

The control events are users's requests to cart. Every user's request
handled by the following way:

- cart interface (cart.php for the customer, admin.php for the administrator)
  receives the request and initializes the top-level cart component;
- the top-level component starts the session, initializes modules and
  visualisation subsystem;
- the top-level component passes the event to requests broker dispatcher;
- the request broker dispatcher analyzes the request and initializes
  corresponding control component (dialog component);
- the dialog component intializes required core components, handles the
  request and passes the resulting data to the visual widget components;
- finally, visualization subsystem displays the request result(s) to user's
  browser.

View components // {{{                                                *view*
===============

During the XLite initialization it creates the full visualization tree
(widgets tree). Dialog component passes the data to the corresponding widgets
and initializes them. Main visualiazation component displays only initialized
widgets. 

The visualization subsystem is based on powerful Flexy template engine.
