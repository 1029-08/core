== What is LiteCommerce?

LiteCommerce is a free PHP/MySQL-driven open-source e-commerce solution that allows you to build a multifunctional e-commerce website (with forums, blog, articles, and so on) instead of just an online catalog with a checkout. LiteCommerce can work with Drupal and use all features provided by this CMS. However it can be installed as stand-alone application and used as online shopping cart with catalog and checkout.
